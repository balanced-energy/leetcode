Run a modified binary search on the input array s
    start = 0
    end = len(s) - 1
    While start <= end 
        Calculate mid = (start + end) // 2
        If s[mid] == target
            Return mid
        We need to check for two cases to find which half of the array is still sorted
        Case 1: s[start] < s[mid] 
            First half is still sorted 
            If target greater than s[start] and less than s[mid].
                We know the target is between startâ€¦mid indices.
                Set end to mid - 1
            Else 
                Set start to mid + 1
        Case 2: s[start] > s[mid]
            Second half still sorted
            If target greater than s[mid] and less than s[end].
                We know the target is between mid..end indices.
                Set start to mid + 1

            Else 
                Set end to mid - 1

Return - 1. Target was not found
